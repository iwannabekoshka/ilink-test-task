## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

It was my first try with Git branches. Awesome tool, despite I used not so many features.
I had an issue with deployment to Github Pages: my styles wasn't applied. So I created a branch called **_deployment_test_**
and tested some stuff to fix this problem. But unfortunately I should merge this branch to MASTER every time when 
I want to see changes. But it was good experience anyway :)

Also, I have learned Markdown language. It is nice and simple.

### Continued development

I want to use Git branches more and maybe go for a Sass.
